**Clone repo :**
Note: use latest `TAG` for released versions or `develop`/`main` as `BRANCH` .
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rdkcentral/rdke-refui -b develop
$ cd rdke-refui/accelerator-home-ui
```
Note: if you are not able to launch offline UI, add `.env` file inside `accelerator-home-ui/` and add `LNG_BUNDLER=esbuild` to force the bundler. Make sure you have esbuild dependency (`npm install esbuild`)
```
$ npm install
```
Build
```
$ lng build
```

**Install as offline-app :**
```
$ cd accelerator-home-ui/dist/<es6>/
```
Replace the dummy icons with original and then tar the entire contents to deploy on the offline UI location on device.

Note: On a RDKV reference device; the `lighttpd` webserver is configured to load the offline UI from `server.document-root` which includes the alias `lxresui` of the above dist file mapped for loading. Default alias maps the directory `/home/root/lxresui/`.

**Host the app locally to test :**
```
$ lng serve
```
It will print the local url as : `http://127.0.0.1:8080` which can be loaded as url to the `residentApp.sh` which is responsible for offline UI url loading on STB.
